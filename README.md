# Audio AI

## Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to assist experts, such as Occupational Health Physicians, who conduct interviews via telephone or video call. It aims to automate the process of preparing reports and clinical notes based on the conversation, while also adjusting the template to align with the specific case and company policy requirements.

## Features

- **Record and Import Audio Files**: Capture or upload audio recordings for processing.
- **Playback Control**: Play, pause, and shift through audio files with ease.
- **Transcription & Analysis**: Automatically transcribe, align, and diarize audio files to identify speakers and organize content.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract meaningful insights from transcriptions.
  - **Timestamped References**: Maintain accurate time references for each part of the conversation.
  - **Interactive Playback**: Click on any transcribed text to play the corresponding audio segment.
- **Customizable Templates**: Generate tailored documents based on client-specific requirements and preferences.

## Inspiration

Initially, I relied on tools like Tactiq, but I encountered limitations such as restricted customization options, lack of diarization, and no report generation capabilities. These shortcomings inspired me to build my own solution through this project, addressing these gaps and adding enhanced features. My hope is that this tool will one day prove valuable to others facing similar challenges! :)
